An algorithm that ranks potholes as the cars pass through them.

## Description
This algorithm aims to segment and group spatial points generated by a vibration sensor during a car trip.</br>
This sensor was primarily installed on mobile phones so that you could use your hardware.</br>

* An application that has a similar result: [Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrystianvieyra.physicstoolboxsuite)

Due to the metric used, the algorithm detects street bumps as candidates for potholes, to solve this problem, I used a dataset of all street bumps cataloged by the city of SÃ£o Paulo obtained by the [law of access to information](http://www.sic.sp.gov.br/), to disregard any detection that shares the same geographic location.

I try to let the main notebook self explanatory, but if you have any doubts, feel free to send me an email.
